# AImacs

Emacs Fast Start
----------------

## Installation

Before start, make sure that you don't have `.emacs` and `.emacs.d` in your home directory:

```
ls -la ~/ | grep emacs
```

This command shouldn't return anything!

Since you don't have any files in your home directory, let's begin!  

#### Clone the repo in your home directory:

```
cd ~/
git init .
git remote add origin https://github.com/gabriben/AImacs.git
git fetch origin
git checkout master
```
